# limpEngine
one out of thousands 3D engines ;)

This engine was part of a school project. Basically it is a large OpenGL Wrapper
where some mathematical parts are done in C++ to learn how projections and rotations work.

The subproject LuaInterface is a template based library to support
communications between Lua and C++ in both directions.
